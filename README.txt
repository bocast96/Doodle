To run file:

Pull from repository and run to emulator on android studio. All images should be included in github.
I ran the app on a nexus 6 with an api > 15.

* important:
my app requires permission in order to store save the drawings as images. Normaly the OS will ask the user if permissions are granted when an app is first installed. because this app is not being installed OS never asks so permission needs to be granted manually.

use these steps:
Settings -> Apps -> Doodle -> Permissions:
trun on "storage"
